/*
Lambda Calculus proivdes a way to _____ using three things.

Lambda Calculus uses only functions, no data types, to represent fundamental features of programming
like numbers or boolean logic. 

An expression in Lambda calculus can be one of three things: expression = variable || abstraction || application. 
    1. Variable x is an expression itself
    2. Abstraction = λ(variable).(expression). For example, λx.x.
    3. Application ==> (expression1)(expression2)

Let's dig into each of the items above.
Variables are expressions themselves and are represented by x, y, z, etc.

Think of an abstraction like the definition of a function. In λx.x:
    λ signals "the following is a function!"
    x (the x directly after λ and before .) is your argument that will be passed into the body...
    .x is the body of your function. This is where arguments are entered and stuff happens/is returned.

    Think of λx.x like: function stuff(x) {return x};

An application where application = (expression)(expression) might consist of two functions
or a function and a variable or even more than two functions with multiple variables. This
is best understood with examples...
