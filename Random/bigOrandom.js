/*
1 is constant time
2n is linear
2n^3 is polynomial
2 ^n is exponential

With logs, the smaller bases grow more quicly than the higher bases
log2n grows more quickly than log8n


To conclude, the correct order of the functions from slowest to fastest would be:

    64
    log8n
    log2n
    3n
    nlog6n
    nlog2n
    8n^2
    6n^3
    8^2n
