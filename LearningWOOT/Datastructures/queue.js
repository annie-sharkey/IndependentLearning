/*
Imposter's handbook

Also like an array but can't access values randomly using an index
Add values at one end and retrieve from other
Explicit methods: enqueue and dequeue

FIFO
enqueue an object to the end and dequeue from the front

can implement using two stacks 
how would you do this without calling enqueue 5 times and then dequeue
and then enqueue?
